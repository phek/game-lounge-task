# Gamelounge

This project was created as a code test for the company Game Lounge.
You can read the task description in task_description.md.

The application is created with only pure AngularJS, HTML and CSS3. No additional dependencies were added.

Instead of using Bootstrap for icons such as the hamburger and arrows I created them myself with pure CSS3.

Instead of using SASS/LESS for templating I used CSS3 variables. See (src/assets/css/variables/theme.css).

All animations are created by using CSS3 transitions and Angular class data-binding.

**If SASS/LESS is a requirement I can create another version using this too.**
